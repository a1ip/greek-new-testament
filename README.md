greek-new-testament
===================

This directory contains the SBLGNT and Nestle1904 editions of the Greek New Testament with syntax trees produced by the Global Bible Initiative, and Lowfat trees created from them.

If we publish other representations of the Greek New Testament, they will be added to this directory.

These files are generally too large to read online, please download them in order to use them. They are designed to be used by software, not to be read by end users.

For other high quality resources suitable to scholarly study of Greek and Hebrew, see the [Biblical Humanities Dashboard](http://biblicalhumanities.org/dashboard/).

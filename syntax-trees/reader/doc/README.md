# Lowfat Syntax Tree Browser

This is a bare-bones browser for the Lowfat Syntax Trees.  To use it, simply type a verse reference into the text box and hit the "Go" button or hit the return key.  The browser positions to that verse.  You can scroll up and down to see neighboring verses.

Boxes indicate clauses.  Within each clause, the following labels are used:

Label | Part of Speech
------|----------------
s     | Subject
v     | Verb
io    | Indirect Object
o     | Object
o2    | Second Object
vc    | Verbal Copula (a verb like "is" that takes a predicate)
p     | Predicate
adv   | Adverbial (often used for adjuncts)

This first version is intentionally very basic.  New features will be added to make it more useful, including queries and support for looking up words and viewing morphology, but it will be kept simple and focused on syntax trees.

The syntax tree data is freely licensed - feel free to use it in your application.

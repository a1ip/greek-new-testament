Lowfat trees derived from the [PROIEL Treebank](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank) using [proiel2lowfat.xquery]( https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/greek-new-testament/blob/master/syntax-trees/xquery/proiel2lowfat.xquery).  This provides a "second opinion" on the GBI analysis by converting from two very different frameworks to Lowfat.

Note that this does not include the complete New Testament.  See PROIEL's [README.md](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank/blob/master/README.md), which describes the coverage of their analysis.

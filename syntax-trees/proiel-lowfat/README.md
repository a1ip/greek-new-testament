Lowfat trees derived from the [PROIEL Treebank](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank) using [proiel2lowfat.xquery]( https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/greek-new-testament/blob/master/syntax-trees/xquery/proiel2lowfat.xquery).  This provides a "second opinion" on the GBI analysis by converting from two very different frameworks to Lowfat and illustrates the fact that dependency trees can be converted to constituency (and vice versa) provided the analysis is consistent and well conceived.

Note that this does not include the complete New Testament.  See PROIEL's [README.md](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank/blob/master/README.md), which describes the coverage of their analysis.
